# WeMine Automation Repository (Mock Version)

This repository contains a **mock / placeholder automation project** created to 
illustrate how the WeMine platform (Web, Mobile, API) *could* be automated using 
best-practice test architecture.

The code, folder structure, test cases, and examples included here are:

- Conceptual  
- Representational  
- Demonstration-only  
- Not connected to real production endpoints  
- Not using real credentials, tenants, or data  
- Not guaranteed to run without actual app builds and backend integration  

---

## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this mock project is to:

- Demonstrate a **scalable automation architecture**  
- Show how Web (Playwright), Mobile (Appium + WebdriverIO), and API tests can coexist  
- Provide **example test flows** for:
  - Sign-In flow and master data sync  
  - Dynamic form builder  
  - Equipment Inspection submission  
  - Safety Hazard reporting and follow-up workflow  
- Represent how real automation *would be structured* in a production setting  
- Serve as a **task QA case** for Bukit Teknologi assignment

This repository is **NOT** intended to be a fully functional automation suite.
